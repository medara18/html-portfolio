  I am an experienced professional always looking to learn new things and develop. In my work, I give more than 100%, and I do my job with passion, as my career path is something I love doing. I am looking for a workplace where I can gather new skills and also put my experience into practice. I am always open to new ways of doing things, and I can challenge the status quo as I am not afraid of challenges.

<p>In my free time, I am learning web development and I am writing poetry and prose.</p>
